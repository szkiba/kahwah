# 🍵 Kahwah

Test runner for [k6](https://k6.io/). The design of the Kahwah library was inspired by Mocha. If you already know Mocha framework, using this library should be very simple.  Kahwah tests run serially and supports passing values between tests. This makes it easy to connect tests as workfow test steps.
